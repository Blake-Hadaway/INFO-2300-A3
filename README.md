# INFO-2300-A3

This is my assignment 3 for my INFO2300: Project Development class. This repo will contain a sample project with proper README, license, issue tracking, and testing.

## Issue Tracking
This project uses GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and feature requests. If you encounter any issues, please report them at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Blake-Hadaway/INFO-2300-A3/issues).

## Purpose of Project
This project is a mock website of a game store like steam, where users will come sign up, and then shop for gamesmadd them to their cart, or their wishlist. They will also be able to see what their friends have in their wishlists, and even share their wishlist with friends or family. There is also events that are posted on our store, these event can be signed up once the user has made an account with us.

### Step 1
To start this application, download the source code for this github, open or install Visual Studio, when that is open, select ”Open a project or solution”.

### Step 2
Navigate to the project folder, and find the file named “ConestogaVirtualGameStore.sln”, then select the open option.

### Step 3
When the solution file is opened in Visual Studio, select the option “Start Without Debugging”.

### Step 4
Now we need to create the database for our webpage. To create the Database, open SQL Server and connect to your server.

### Step 5
In Visual Studio, go to Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console. In the console, type "Update-Database” and press enter and wait till it says done.

### Step 6
Congrats! You have successfully created the database on your SQL Server application. Now you may use the webpage to your hearts content.

## Licence
I have chosen the MIT License because it offers the best balance of permissions and protection. It allows anyone who clones this project to use, modify, distribute, and incorporate the code into other projects with minimal restrictions. This license also makes it easier for others to contribute and integrate the project’s code while maintaining flexibility and openness.
